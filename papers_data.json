It has resulted in enormous economic as\nwell as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in\na region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major\nproblem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts\ncertain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such\neconomic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,\nthere is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,\nwhich is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul\nSamuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or\notherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future\ngenerations.",

Such model is alike to transition from\nkinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.\nAggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro\nvariables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and\nfinancial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.\nAggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y\ndetermine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of\nmacro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions\nbetween macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.\nWe show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of\neconomic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit\ntransactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to\nBorrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe\nrepayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x.

First, we estimate the regional economic\ncomplexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'\nECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic\ndevelopment and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of\nECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare\ndifferent measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with\nmonetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the\nnon-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have\nstronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate\nregressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other\nsocioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better\nunderstanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary\nmacroeconomic indicators.",

The study\nanalyzed trends in nutritional health and economic factors before and after the\npandemic and gathered personal accounts regarding nutrition and economic\ndifficulties during this period. Findings showed a clear link between the\neconomic downturn and deteriorating nutritional health, particularly in\nlow-income and marginalized groups.

In\nthe paper Economic Forces and the Stock Market 1986, the authors introduced an\nattribution model to identify the specific systematic economic forces\ninfluencing the market. They first defined and examined five classic factors\nfrom previous research papers: Industrial Production, Unanticipated Inflation,\nChange in Expected Inflation, Risk Premia, and The Term Structure. By adding in\nnew factors, the Market Indices, Consumptions and Oil Prices, one by one, they\nexamined the significant contribution of each factor to the stock return. The\npaper concluded that the stock returns are exposed to the systematic economic\nnews, and they are priced with respect to their risk exposure. Also, the\nsignificant factors can be identified by simply adopting their model. Driven by\nsuch motivation, we conduct an attribution analysis based on the general\nframework of their model to further prove the importance of the economic\nfactors and identify the specific identity of significant factors.",

In the mainstream school of economics, namely neoclassical\ntheories, economic issues are dealt with in a mechanistic manner. Such a\nmainstream framework is majorly focused on investigating a socio-economic\nsystem based on an axiomatic scheme where reductionism approach plays a vital\nrole. The major limitations of such theories include unbounded rationality of\neconomic agents, reducing the economic aggregates to a set of predictable\nfactors and lack of attention to adaptability and the evolutionary nature of\neconomic agents. In tackling deficiencies of conventional economic models, in\nthe past two decades, some new approaches have been recruited. One of those\nnovel approaches is the Complex adaptive systems (CAS) framework which has\nshown a very promising performance in action. In contrast to mainstream school,\nunder this framework, the economic phenomena are studied in an organic manner\nwhere the economic agents are supposed to be both boundedly rational and\nadaptive. According to it, the economic aggregates emerge out of the ways\nagents of a system decide and interact. As a powerful way of modeling CASs,\nAgent-based models (ABMs) has found a growing application among academicians\nand practitioners. ABMs show that how simple behavioral rules of agents and\nlocal interactions among them at micro-scale can generate surprisingly complex\npatterns at macro-scale. In this paper, ABMs have been used to show (1) how an\neconomic inequality emerges in a system and to explain (2) how sadaqah as an\nIslamic charity rule can majorly help alleviating the inequality and how\nresource allocation strategies taken by charity entities can accelerate this\nalleviation.",

In many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of\nCobb and Douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to\neconomic theories, i.e. they were built to fit economic phenomena. In this\npaper, we look at these functions from the complementary side: information. We\nuse a recent toolbox built on top of a vast class of distortions coined by\nBregman, whose application field rivals metrics' in various subfields of\nmathematics. This toolbox makes it possible to find the quality of an\naggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc.), from the\nstandpoint of the information it carries. We prove a rather striking result.\n  From the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong\nto the \\textit{optimal} set. As common economic assumptions enter the analysis,\nthis large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up \\textit{exactly fitting}\neither CES, or Cobb-Douglas, or both. To summarize, in the relevant economic\ncontexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the\ninformation standpoint. We also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal\ninformation aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of the links\nbetween economic and information aggregators.\n  Keywords: Economic Aggregators, CES, Cobb-Douglas, Bregman divergences",

China is\nespecially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its\nkind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates\neconomic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.\nFar from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure\ninvestment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's\ntrack record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich\ndemocracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive\nprojects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in\nfinancial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We\nconclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation\nof surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless\nChina shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the\ncountry is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic\ncrisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.\nChina's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other\ncountries but one to avoid.",

The economic information includes\nchoice predictions, choice probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns\nof alternatives, social welfare, probability derivatives, elasticities,\nmarginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of time (VOT).\nUnlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal\nbehavioral patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the\neconomic information obtained from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three\nchallenges associated with the automatic learning capacity: high sensitivity to\nhyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity. To\ndemonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a\nstated preference survey, extracted the full list of economic information from\nthe DNNs, and compared them with those from the DCMs. We found that the\neconomic information either aggregated over trainings or population is more\nreliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or\ntrainings, and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly\nimprove the reliability of the economic information extracted from the DNNs.\nFuture studies should investigate other regularizations and DNN architectures,\nbetter optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address\nDNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from\nDNN-based choice models.",

At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of\ncounterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to\nexperiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that\nmachine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism\ndesign framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a\ntwo-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who\nco-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel\ntwo-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn\nrational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal\ntaxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal\ntax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist\nsubstantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off\nbetween equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent\ntax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral\nchange more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the\nfirst time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a\ncomplement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational\nlearning-based approach to understanding economic policy.",

Towards serving the demand of\nintegration, this paper develops a three-dimensional index, capturing\nengineering, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of economic resilience that\nare considered separately in the current literature. The proposed index is\ncomputed on GDP data of worldwide countries, for the period 1960-2020,\nconcerning 14 crises considered as shocks, and was found well defined in a\nconceptual context of its components. Its application on real-world data allows\nintroducing a novel classification of countries in terms of economic\nresilience, and reveals geographical patterns and structural determinants of\nthis attribute. Impressively enough, economic resilience appears positively\nrelated to major productivity coefficients, gravitationally driven, and\ndepended on agricultural specialization, with high structural heterogeneity in\nthe low class. Also, the analysis fills the literature gap by shaping the\nworldwide map of economic resilience, revealing geographical duality and\ncentrifugal patterns in its geographical distribution, a relationship between\ndiachronically good performance in economic resilience and geographical\ndistance from the shocks origin, and a continent differentiation expressed by\nthe specialization of America in engineering resilience, Africa and Asia in\necological and evolutionary resilience, and a relative lag of Europe and\nOceania. Finally, the analysis provides insights into the effect of the 2008 on\nthe globe and supports a further research hypothesis that political instability\nis a main determinant of low economic resilience, addressing avenues of further\nresearch.",

We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in\nwhich the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and\nnegative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the\nactivities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find\nstrong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic\nactivities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These\nresults suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a\nsignificant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence\nobtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by\ndifferences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,\nand historical contingencies.

Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but\ntestable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross\ncorrelation between energy consumption and economic output at the national\nlevel through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of\nprecise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive\nevidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual\ncommodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has\naccumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides\nus the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value\ncorrelation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical\nelements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining\nthem from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear\ncorrelation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying\nphysics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such\nas the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic\nvaluation.

We develop\nsuccessive approximations that link up predictions of the market-based\nprobabilities of price and return for the whole stock market with predictions\nof price and return probabilities for stocks of a particular company and show\nthat economic complexity limits the accuracy of any forecasts. The economic\norigin of the restrictions lies in the fact that the predictions of the m-th\nstatistical moments of price and return require descriptions of the economic\nvariables composed by sums of the m-th powers of economic or market\ntransactions during an averaging time interval. The attempts to predict the\nn-th statistical moments of price and return of stocks that are under the\naction of a single risk result in estimates of the n-dimensional risk rating\nvectors for economic agents. In turn, the risk rating vectors play the role of\ncoordinates for the description of the evolution of economic variables. The\nlack of a model description of the economic variables composed by sums of the\n2-d and higher powers of market transactions causes that, in the coming years,\nthe accuracy of the forecasts will be limited at best by the first two\nstatistical moments of price and return, which determine Gaussian\ndistributions.

        "summary": "The Economy Watcher Survey, which is a market survey published by the\nJapanese government, contains \\emph{assessments of current and future economic\nconditions} by people from various fields. Although this survey provides\ninsights regarding economic policy for policymakers, a clear definition of the\nword \"future\" in future economic conditions is not provided. Hence, the\nassessments respondents provide in the survey are simply based on their\ninterpretations of the meaning of \"future.\" This motivated us to reveal the\ndifferent interpretations of the future in their judgments of future economic\nconditions by applying weakly supervised learning and text mining. In our\nresearch, we separate the assessments of future economic conditions into\neconomic conditions of the near and distant future using learning from positive\nand unlabeled data (PU learning). Because the dataset includes data from\nseveral periods, we devised new architecture to enable neural networks to\nconduct PU learning based on the idea of multi-task learning to efficiently\nlearn a classifier. Our empirical analysis confirmed that the proposed method\ncould separate the future economic conditions, and we interpreted the\nclassification results to obtain intuitions for policymaking.",

        "summary": "The popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in economics have\nbeen exponentially increased. DRL through a wide range of capabilities from\nreinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL) for handling sophisticated\ndynamic business environments offers vast opportunities. DRL is characterized\nby scalability with the potential to be applied to high-dimensional problems in\nconjunction with noisy and nonlinear patterns of economic data. In this work,\nwe first consider a brief review of DL, RL, and deep RL methods in diverse\napplications in economics providing an in-depth insight into the state of the\nart. Furthermore, the architecture of DRL applied to economic applications is\ninvestigated in order to highlight the complexity, robustness, accuracy,\nperformance, computational tasks, risk constraints, and profitability. The\nsurvey results indicate that DRL can provide better performance and higher\naccuracy as compared to the traditional algorithms while facing real economic\nproblems at the presence of risk parameters and the ever-increasing\nuncertainties.",

The\namount of carbon emission caused by production activities is closely related to\nthe socio-economic environment. Therefore, from the perspective of economic\npolicy uncertainty, this article constructs the GARCH-MIDAS-EUEPU and\nGARCH-MIDAS-GEPU models for investigating the impact of European and global\neconomic policy uncertainty on carbon price fluctuations. The results show that\nboth European and global economic policy uncertainty will exacerbate the\nlong-term volatility of European carbon spot return, with the latter having a\nstronger impact when the change is the same. Moreover, the volatility of the\nEuropean carbon spot return can be forecasted better by the predictor, global\neconomic policy uncertainty. This research can provide some implications for\nmarket managers in grasping carbon market trends and helping participants\ncontrol the risk of fluctuations in carbon allowances.",

        "summary": "This paper aims to estimate the impact of economic and financial crises on\nthe unemployment rate in the European Union, taking also into consideration the\ninstitutional specificities, since unemployment was the main channel through\nwhich the economic and financial crisis influenced the social developments.. In\nthis context, I performed two institutional clusters depending on their\ninclusive or extractive institutional features and, in each cases, I computed\nthe crisis effect on unemployment rate over the 2003-2017 period. Both models\nwere estimated by using Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares method, and\nare weighted by Period SUR option in order to remove, in advance the possible\ninconveniences of the models. The institutions proved to be a relevant\ncriterion that drives the impact of economic and financial crises on the\nunemployment rate, highlighting that countries with inclusive institutions are\nless vulnerable to economic shocks and are more resilient than countries with\nextractive institutions. The quality of institutions was also found to have a\nsignificant effect on the response of unemployment rate to the dynamic of its\ndrivers.",

        "summary": "To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have\n`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such\nlockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study\nexamines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact\nthrough supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an\nagent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in\nJapan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the\ninteractions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by\ndecomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We\nfind that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier\nsubstitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the\neconomic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region\nlifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on\nwhether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked\nthrough supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy\ncoordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.",

The mutual relationship between the urbanization of any country and\nits economic productive structure is far from being understood. We analyzed the\nhistorical evolution of product exports for all countries using the World Trade\nWeb (WTW) with respect to patterns of urbanization from 1995-2010. Using the\nevolving framework of economic complexity, we reveal that a country's economic\ndevelopment in terms of its production and export of goods, is interwoven with\nthe urbanization process during the early stages of its economic development\nand growth. Meanwhile in urbanized countries, the reciprocal relation between\neconomic growth and urbanization fades away with respect to its later stages,\nbecoming negligible for countries highly dependent on the export of resources\nwhere urbanization is not linked to any structural economic transformation.",
